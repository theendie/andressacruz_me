  "content": "This space aims to share a little of who I am, which is a lot. I use NextJS and Heroku.com, here you can see https:\/\/github.com/theendie/endie. I don't believe we can completely separate the personal from the professional side, since we are one being, and we are much more than we can imagine. Therefore, you will see here a little of Endi, a developer, technologist, gamer, also an aspiring philosopher and artisan."
